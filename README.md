Hey there, awesome validator folks!

If you want your own personalized website on Hodla, just shoot a DM to @superhyped on Telegram. We'll walk you through all the cool stuff and talk about the terms of partnership!

After that, all you gotta do is make a PR in this repository, and voil√†, we'll work our magic to create your very own space in Hodla.

Creating your space is pretty easy:
1. Head to the "validators" folder and create a new folder with your validator name. Easy peasy! Let's say your folder name is "exampleValidator" (yep, it's already there for you to check out), then your link will be _hodla.org/examplevalidator_.
2. Inside the folder, add a JSON file (with optional naming, but the folder should only contain one JSON file). You can see an example of the format [https://github.com/hodla-app/validators/blob/main/validators/exampleValidator/exampleValidator.json](here). Here are some tips:
- Required fields: "name" and "networks" (gotta have at least one element in the networks array). The remaining fields are optional, but if you want a higher conversion rate into staked assets, it's recommended to provide more information!
- Keep your validator name short, think mobile-friendly.
- Describe your validator briefly and snappily; long descriptions can be a bummer on mobile phones.
3. Oh, and don't forget to throw in your cool icon (totally optional, though!). Go for a 512x512 or 1024x1024 PNG format.

Once you've done all that and made a PR, our team will work their magic and, in case of approval, automatically create your personal space in Hodla.

We're stoked to have you on board!
